\item \points{3a}
Random ghosts are of course not optimal minimax agents, so modeling them with
minimax search is not optimal. Instead, write down the recurrence for
$V_{\text{exptmax}}(s,d)$, which is the maximum expected utility against ghosts
that each follow the random policy, which chooses a legal move uniformly at
random. Your recurrence should resemble that of problem 1a, which means that you
should write it in terms of the same functions that were specified in problem
1a.
