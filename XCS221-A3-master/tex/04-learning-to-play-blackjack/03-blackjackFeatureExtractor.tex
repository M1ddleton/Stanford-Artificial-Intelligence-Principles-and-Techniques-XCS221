To address the problems explored in the previous exercise, let's incorporate
some domain knowledge to improve generalization.  This way, the algorithm can
use what it has learned about some states to improve its prediction performance
on other states. Implement |blackjackFeatureExtractor| as described
in the code comments. Using this feature extractor, you should be able to get
pretty close to the optimum on the |largeMDP|.
