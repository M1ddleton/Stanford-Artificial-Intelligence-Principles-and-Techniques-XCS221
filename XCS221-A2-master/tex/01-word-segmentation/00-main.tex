\item {\bf Word Segmentation}

In word segmentation, you are given as input a string of alphabetical characters
(|[a-z]|) without whitespace, and your goal is to insert spaces into this
string such that the result is the most fluent according to the language model.

\begin{enumerate}

  \input{01-word-segmentation/01-suboptimal}

  \input{01-word-segmentation/02-segmentation-problem}

\end{enumerate}
