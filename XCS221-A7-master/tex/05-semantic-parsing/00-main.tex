\item {\bf Semantic Parsing}

Semantic parsing is the task of converting natural lanugage utterances into
first-order logic formulas. We have created a small set of grammar rules in the
code for you in |createBaseEnglishGrammar()|. In this problem, you will add
additional grammar rules to handle a wider variety of sentences. Specifically,
create a |GrammarRule| for each of the following sentence structures.

\begin{enumerate}

  \input{05-semantic-parsing/01-every-person}

  \input{05-semantic-parsing/02-some-cat}

  \input{05-semantic-parsing/03-former-feeds-latter}

\end{enumerate}

After implementing these functions, you should be able to try some simple
queries using |nli.py|! For example:
\begin{lstlisting}
(XCS221) $ python nli.py
============================================================
Hello!  Talk to me in English.
Tell me something new (end the sentence with '.') or ask me a question (end the sentence with '?').
Type 'help' for additional commands.
------------------------------
> Every person likes some cat.

>>>>> I learned something.
------------------------------
> Every cat is a mammal.

>>>>> I learned something.
------------------------------
> Every person likes some mammal?

>>>>> Yes.
\end{lstlisting}
