\item {\bf Odd and Even Integers}

In this problem, we will see how to use logic to automatically prove
mathematical theorems.  We will focus on encoding the theorem and leave the
proving part to the logical inference algorithm. Here is the theorem:

If the following constraints hold:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., itemsep=0em]
   \item Each number $x$ has exactly one successor, which is not equal to $x$.
   \item Each number is either odd or even, but not both.
   \item The successor of an even number is odd.
   \item The successor of an odd number is even.
   \item For every number $x$, the successor of $x$ is larger than $x$.
   \item Larger is a transitive property: if $x$ is larger than $y$ and $y$ is
        larger than $z$, then $x$ is larger than $z$.
\end{enumerate}
Then we have the following consequence:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For each number, there is an even number larger than it.
\end{itemize}

{\em Note: in this problem, "larger than" is just an arbitrary relation, and you
should not assume it has any prior meaning.  In other words, don't assume things
like ``a number can't be larger than itself'' unless explicitly stated.}
