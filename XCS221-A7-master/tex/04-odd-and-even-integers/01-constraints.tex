\item \points{4a}
Fill out |ints()| to construct six formulas for each of the constraints.  The
consequence has been filled out for you (|query| in the code). You can test your
code using the following commands:
\begin{lstlisting}
python grader.py 4a-0-basic
python grader.py 4a-1-basic
python grader.py 4a-2-basic
python grader.py 4a-3-basic
python grader.py 4a-4-basic
python grader.py 4a-5-basic
python grader.py 4a-all-basic  # Tests the conjunction of all the formulas
\end{lstlisting}

To finally prove the theorem, |tell| the formulas to the knowledge base and
|ask| the query by running model checking (on a finite model):
\begin{lstlisting}
python grader.py 4a-all-basic
\end{lstlisting}
