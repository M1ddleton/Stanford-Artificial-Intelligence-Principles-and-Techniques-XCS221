Now try to use the course scheduler for the winter and spring quarters (and next
year if applicable). Create your own |profile.txt| and then run the course
scheduler:
\begin{lstlisting}
python run_p2.py profile.txt
\end{lstlisting}

You might want to turn on the appropriate heuristic flags to speed up the
computation. Does it produce a reasonable course schedule? Please include your
|profile.txt| and the best schedule in your writeup; we're curious how it worked
out for you! Please include your schedule and the profile in the PDF, otherwise
you will not receive credit.
