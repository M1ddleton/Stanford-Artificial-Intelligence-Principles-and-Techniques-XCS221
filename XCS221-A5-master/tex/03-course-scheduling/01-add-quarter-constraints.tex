Implement the function |add_quarter_constraints()| in |submission.py|. This is
when your profile specifies which quarter(s) you want your requested courses to
be taken in. This is not saying that one of the courses must be taken,
{\em but if it is}, then it must be taken in any one of the specified quarters.
Also note that this constraint will apply to all courses in that request.

We have written a |verify_schedule()| function in |grader.py| that determines if
your schedule satisfies all of the given constraints. Note that since we are not
dealing with units yet, it will print |None| for the number of units of each
course. For profile2a.txt, you should find 3 optimal assignments with weight 1.0.
