Let's create a CSP. Suppose you have $n$ light bulbs, where each light bulb
$i = 1, \dots, n$ is initially off. You also have $m$ buttons which control the
lights. For each button $j = 1, \dots, m$, we know the subset $T_j \subseteq
\{ 1, \dots, n \}$ of light bulbs that it controls. When button $j$ is pressed,
it toggles the state of each light bulb in $T_j$ (For example, if $3 \in T_j$
and light bulb 3 is off, then after the button is pressed, light bulb 3 will be
on, and vice versa).

Your goal is to turn on all the light bulbs by pressing a subset of the buttons.
Construct a CSP to solve this problem. Your CSP should have $m$ variables and
$n$ constraints. {\em For this problem only}, you can use $n$-ary constraints.
Describe your CSP precisely and concisely. You need to specify the variables
with their domain, and the constraints with their scope and expression. Make
sure to include $T_j$ in your answer.
