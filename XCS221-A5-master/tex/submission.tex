% This contents of this file will be inserted into the _Solutions version of the
% output tex document.  Here's an example:

% If assignment with subquestion (1.a) requires a written response, you will
% find the following flag within this document: <SCPD_SUBMISSION_TAG>_1a
% In this example, you would insert the LaTeX for your solution to (1.a) between
% the <SCPD_SUBMISSION_TAG>_1a flags.  If you also constrain your answer between the
% START_CODE_HERE and END_CODE_HERE flags, your LaTeX will be styled as a
% solution within the final document.

% Please do not use the '<SCPD_SUBMISSION_TAG>' character anywhere within your code.  As expected,
% that will confuse the regular expressions we use to identify your solution.

This handout includes space for every question that requires a written response.
Please feel free to use it to handwrite your solutions (legibly, please).  If
you choose to typeset your solutions, the |README.md| for this assignment includes
instructions to regenerate this handout with your typeset \LaTeX{} solutions.
