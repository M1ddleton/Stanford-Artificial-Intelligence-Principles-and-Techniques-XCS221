\item \points{3a}


Many uses of constraint satisfaction in real-world scenarios involve assignment of
resources to entities, like assigning packages to different trucks to optimize delivery.
However, when the agents are people, the issue of fair division arises.
In this question, you will consider the ethics of what constraints to remove in a CSP
when the CSP is unsatisfiable.\\


Medical residents are often scheduled to work long shifts with insufficient rest,
leading to exhaustion and burnout. This can negatively affect the residents and potentially
lead to mistakes that also negatively affect the patients in their care \footnote{\href{https://knowledgeplus.nejm.org/blog/resident-burnout-well-being/}{Akresh-Gonzales et al. Resident Burnout and Well-Being: A Q\&A with Educator Benjamin R. Doolittle, MD}}.
A hospital could use a constraint-satisfaction approach to try to create a work schedule
that respects the ‚Äúon-call night, day-off, rest period, and total work-hour regulations
mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, as well as the number
of residents needed each hour given the demand (aka number of patients and
procedures scheduled) \footnote{\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054810001024}{Topaloglu et al. A constraint programming-based solution approach for medical resident scheduling problems. Computers \& Operations Research. 2011.}}.
The constraints are:\\

\begin{enumerate}[1]
    \item One day off every 7 days
    \item Minimum 8 hour rest period between shifts
    \item  No more than 80 hours of work per week averaged over a 4 week period
    \item At least 14 hours free of clinical work and education after 24 hours of in-house call
    \item Number of residents needed each hour
\end{enumerate}

Let‚Äôs assume for a given hospital that the constraints listed above were collectively
\textbf{unsatisfiable} given the number of residents assigned to that hospital.
However, its formulation as an unsatisfiable CSP depends on other factors remaining fixed, such as\\

\begin{enumerate}[A]
    \item The number of total residents
    \item The work to be performed by residents as opposed to other staff
    \item The budget available to hire residents or other staff
\end{enumerate}

In this case, would you remove one of the numbered constraints 1-5 or
advocate that the hospital administration change one of A-C to make the problem solveable?
If so, explain which one and give a reason why.\\

\textbf{What we expect:} In 2-4 sentences, you must explicitly state which numbered constraint or lettered factor you would change and justify your choice with a reason that
explains why you chose that one.\\
