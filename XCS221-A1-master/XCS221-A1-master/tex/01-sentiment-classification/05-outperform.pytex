\item \points{1e}

Run your linear predictor with feature extractor |extractCharacterFeatures|.
Experiment with different values of $n$ to see which one produces the smallest
test error.  You should observe that this error is nearly as small as that
produced by word features. Why is this the case?

Construct a review (one sentence max) in which character $n$-grams probably
outperform word features, and briefly explain why this is so.

\textbf{Note:} There is a function in |submission.py| that will allow you 
to test different values of $n$. See the |Docstring| of |testValuesOfN(n)| how to run it.
Remember to write your final written solution.

\textbf{What we expect:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item a short paragraph (~4-6 sentences). In the paragraph state which
value of $n$ produces the smallest validation error, why this is
likely the value that produces the smallest error.

    \item a one-sentence review and explanation for when character $n$-grams
            probably outperform word features.
\end{itemize}
