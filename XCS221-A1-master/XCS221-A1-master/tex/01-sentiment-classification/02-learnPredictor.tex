Implement the function |learnPredictor| using stochastic gradient
descent and minimize the hinge loss. Consider printing the training error and
test error after each iteration to make sure your code is working. You must get
less than 4\% error rate on the training set and less than 30\% error rate on
the dev set to get full credit.
