-1 it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .
+1 wonder , hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of star wars
+1 a true pleasure .
-1 " the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor…it's just plain bored .
+1 a live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze .
+1 jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying .
+1 reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success . he's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness .
+1 at the film's centre is a precisely layered performance by an actor in his mid-seventies , michel piccoli .
+1 too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience .
+1 the way coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining .
+1 the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays .
+1 nicole kidman makes it a party worth attending .
+1 celebrated at sundance , this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy , glib charm that's hard to beat .
-1 a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .
+1 be prepared to cling to the edge of your seat , tense with suspense . the ring never lets you off the hook .
+1 straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it .
+1 a brilliant , absurd collection of vignettes that , in their own idiosyncratic way , sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium .
-1 mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
+1 you don't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that's the mark of a documentary that works .
-1 imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern .
+1 . . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay .
+1 a savage john waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over .
-1 for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .
-1 imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes .
+1 it's hard to imagine anybody ever being " in the mood " to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started .
+1 the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul's perspective .
+1 occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almodóvar style .
+1 allows us to hope that nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker .
+1 like a poor man's you can count on me
-1 shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .
-1 deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered .
-1 smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera .
-1 if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother .
-1 been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional .
-1 needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
-1 crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .
+1 the all-french cast is marveilleux .
-1 one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .
-1 it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
+1 nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre .
+1 the whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film .
+1 a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story .
-1 spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative .
-1 it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .
+1 with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story doesn't have a single surprise up its sleeve . but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell .
-1 the movie bounces all over the map .
-1 director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
-1 so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned .
+1 dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then there's the music . . .
-1 the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
-1 nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .
+1 maybe thomas wolfe was right : you can't go home again .
-1 too slow , too long and too little happens .
+1 famuyiwa's feature deals with its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the cliché-riddled genre can offer .
-1 eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good .
+1 hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels .
+1 if you're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here .
+1 the ring is worth a look , if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your halloween entertainment .
-1 an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten .
+1 if mostly martha is mostly unsurprising , it's still a sweet , even delectable diversion .
-1 a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .
-1 the film is flat .
+1 hilarious , acidic brit comedy .
-1 it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring .
+1 if you're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix , i have just one word for you -– decasia
+1 bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that doesn't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it .
-1 sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?
-1 ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay .
+1 it's stylishly directed with verve . . .
-1 if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it .
+1 the wwii drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear .
-1 to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough .
-1 there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
+1 a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution .
+1 this cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends .
+1 just how these families interact may surprise you .
-1 with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side .
-1 stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here… . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .
+1 it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
+1 with an admirably dark first script by brent hanley , paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work .
-1 as steamy as last week's pork dumplings .
+1 this new zealand coming-of-age movie isn't really about anything . when it's this rich and luscious , who cares ?
-1 not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .
-1 the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
+1 britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway .
-1 what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
-1 the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute .
+1 berling and béart . . . continue to impress , and isabelle huppert . . . again shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters .
-1 lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned .
+1 i don't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh's full frontal , though that didn't stop me from enjoying much of it .
-1 the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list .
+1 just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over .
-1 the film has a childlike quality about it . but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass .
+1 it lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho .
+1 a sharp , amusing study of the cult of celebrity .
+1 gloriously straight from the vagina .
+1 weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title .
-1 dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .
-1 [carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .
-1 a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family .
-1 the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i'm afraid .
-1 . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner .
-1 frenetic but not really funny .
+1 . . . a polished and relatively sincere piece of escapism .
-1 perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy .
+1 the characters are more deeply thought through than in most 'right-thinking' films .
-1 good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
-1 feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class .
+1 the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side .
-1 even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort .
+1 a small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad .
+1 the entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood .
-1 it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
-1 the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .
+1 with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in .
-1 'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
+1 to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it's thanks to huston's revelatory performance .
+1 we've seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world's greatest teacher .
+1 if you're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you're in luck .
+1 visually captivating .
+1 for once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own .
+1 definitely worth 95 minutes of your time .
+1 " on guard ! " won't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time .
-1 the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable .
+1 a brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it .
+1 last orders nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , allowing us to remember that life's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced . it's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective .
-1 formulaic to the 51st power , more like .
-1 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings .
-1 pompous and garbled .
-1 its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess .
+1 it's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our hollywood has all but lost .
+1 but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity .
+1 pacino is the best he's been in years and keener is marvelous .
-1 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .
+1 an average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son's discovery of his homosexuality .
-1 displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
+1 handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy .
-1 most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs .
-1 nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .
+1 if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he doesn't hold them in contempt .
-1 glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .
+1 the film jolts the laughs from the audience--as if by cattle prod .
-1 a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft .
-1 check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock .
+1 it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing .
+1 byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle . instead , he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground .
-1 many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short .
+1 one of the best silly horror movies of recent memory , with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers .
-1 an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film .
+1 chilling in its objective portrait of dreary , lost twenty-first century america .
+1 i've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and i recommend it for its originality alone .
+1 the best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates .
-1 to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation .
-1 great story , bad idea for a movie .
+1 " what really happened ? " is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience .
+1 full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , time out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life .
+1 a sly game of cat and mouse that's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances .
-1 lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago .
-1 predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .
-1 it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
+1 deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant .
+1 achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium .
-1 i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
-1 i'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks .
-1 a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .
-1 i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .
-1 all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .
-1 it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be .
-1 one of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms . spears .
-1 the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
+1 whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck .
-1 collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
+1 although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey
+1 third time's the charm . . . yeah , baby !
-1 video games are more involving than this mess .
+1 director todd solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates .
-1 [creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .
+1 a very funny movie .

+1 marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula .
-1 another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .

+1 a mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser .
-1 after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .
+1 gives an intriguing twist to the french coming-of-age genre .
-1 bluto blutarsky , we miss you .
+1 peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery
+1 a movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults , as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats .
+1 a little better than sorcerer's stone .
+1 a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence .
-1 the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .
+1 " 13 conversations about one thing " is an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling .
+1 a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side of play .
+1 the warnings to resist temptation in this film . . . are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean .
+1 the lady and the duke is eric rohmer's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
-1 the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .
+1 bon appétit ! just like a splendid meal , red dragon satisfies – from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation .
+1 'tobey maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
-1 for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie .
+1 a loving little film of considerable appeal .
+1 this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese's best in more than a decade .
-1 we've liked klein's other work but rollerball left us cold .
-1 while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
-1 the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film . . . is dudsville .
-1 reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down .
-1 however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
+1 parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness .
-1 the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .
+1 a sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect .
+1 the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze .
+1 uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity .
+1 it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience .
-1 i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . .
+1 i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent's complaint .
-1 more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .
+1 a lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers .
-1 it's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid .
-1 a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
-1 the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .
+1 this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap .
+1 a marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption .
+1 visually engrossing , seldom hammy , honorably mexican and burns its kahlories with conviction .
+1 if there's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr . demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a . addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic .
+1 an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true .
-1 every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .
-1 aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .
+1 a venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first-time feature director's understanding of the expressive power of the camera .
-1 not once does it come close to being exciting .
-1 like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create .
-1 the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .
+1 the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year .
+1 [moore's] better at fingering problems than finding solutions . but though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more .
+1 scooby doo is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation .
+1 the movie is well done , but slow .
+1 even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good .
-1 unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers .
+1 the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain .
-1 everyone's to blame here .
+1 it is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise .
-1 muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .
-1 shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom .
+1 this film puts wang at the forefront of china's sixth generation of film makers .

+1 it's a pleasure to see seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies chris rock , garry shandling and colin quinn .
+1 poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter .
-1 adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .
+1 . . . best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report .
+1 essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of aliens .
+1 these are lives worth watching , paths worth following .
-1 with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted .
-1 an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
+1 a touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community .
+1 the plot twists give i am trying to break your heart an attraction it desperately needed .
+1 paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .
+1 more than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling .
-1 as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses .
+1 a fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man .
+1 jacquot's tosca is a treat .
-1 the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
+1 steers , in his feature film debut , has created a brilliant motion picture .
-1 there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .
+1 a thriller made from a completist's checklist rather than with a cultist's passion .
-1 shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
-1 [taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb .
+1 worth the effort to watch .
+1 the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure .
+1 the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained .
-1 as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .
+1 a sweet-natured reconsideration of one of san francisco's most vital , if least widely recognized , creative fountainheads .
-1 feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together .
+1 smith examines the intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country .
-1 highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .
+1 the reason to see " sade " lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis ( auteil ) and emilie ( le besco ) .
+1 worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia .
-1 you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .
-1 there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . " the adventures of pluto nash " is a big time stinker .
-1 i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings .
+1 jones . . . makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $1 . 8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart .
-1 in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
+1 belongs to daniel day-lewis as much as it belongs to martin scorsese ; it's a memorable performance in a big , brassy , disturbing , unusual and highly successful film .
+1 if you like quirky , odd movies and/or the ironic , here's a fun one .
+1 a sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in renaissance spain , and the fact that it's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling .
-1 the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .

+1 you really have to salute writer-director haneke ( he adapted elfriede jelinek's novel ) for making a film that isn't nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch .
+1 schrader examines crane's decline with unblinking candor .

+1 a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not .
+1 but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it's about a very human one .
+1 an uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the italian masterpiece .
+1 that death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world's religions . this deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications .
+1 hits one out of the park for the 'they don't make 'em like that anymore' department .
-1 dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .
-1 there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman .

-1 [javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama .
+1 what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music .
-1 a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .

+1 a genuine mind-bender .
+1 the seaside splendor and shallow , beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going .

-1 a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor .
+1 even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man .
+1 the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time .
-1 it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .
+1 a drama of great power , yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy .

+1 his work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories .
-1 its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .
+1 its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition .
-1 glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum .

-1 . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
-1 unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .

-1 i like it . no , i hate it . no , i love it . . . hell , i dunno .
-1 flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up .
-1 a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home .
+1 . . . begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully .

-1 the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .
-1 any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
+1 a lovably old-school hollywood confection .
-1 how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) .
-1 not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .

-1 a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
-1 suffers from all the excesses of the genre .
+1 your response to its new sequel , analyze that , may hinge on what you thought of the first film .
-1 complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold .
-1 [stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits .

+1 if cinema had been around to capture the chaos of france in the 1790's , one imagines the result would look like something like this .
-1 the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
-1 just a kiss is a just a waste .

+1 . . . even if you've never heard of chaplin , you'll still be glued to the screen .
+1 the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon .
+1 the result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that wasn't at least watchable . but it's also disappointing to a certain degree .
+1 much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive .
+1 sex with strangers is fascinating . . .
+1 the animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst .
+1 for the most part , the film does hold up pretty well .
+1 several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare .
-1 it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull .
-1 . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .
-1 director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two .
+1 visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last .
+1 the komediant is a tale worth catching .
+1 [shyamalan] continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision .
+1 stuffed to the brim with ideas , american instigator michael moore's film is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition .
+1 highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved cool as ice have at last found a worthy follow-up .
-1 not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
-1 it's just not very smart .
+1 for all its problems . . . the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring . . . which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience .
-1 this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action .

+1 an unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage .
+1 unflinchingly bleak and desperate
+1 it's no lie -- big fat liar is a real charmer .
+1 it's enough to watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins .
-1 eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .
+1 the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on büttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history .
+1 i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie-- for its historical significance alone .
-1 not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies .
+1 the beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor .
+1 stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall's intense freight train of a film .
+1 based on dave barry's popular book of the same name , the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters' moves and overlapping story .
+1 vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two english women .
-1 a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
-1 the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama .
-1 for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .
-1 unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
-1 during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' .
-1 i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .
+1 a frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women .
+1 a conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man's right to raise his own children .
+1 westfeldt and juergensen exude a chemistry and comfort level that's both saucy and endearing .
-1 had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .
-1 the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
+1 although very much like the first movie based on j . k . rowling's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude .
+1 a visionary marvel , but it's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this .
-1 what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ?
-1 the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix .

-1 includes too much obvious padding .

+1 an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick .
+1 it's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer's most pleasurable movies .
+1 if the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well .
+1 [fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall] show us the world they love and make us love it , too .
-1 the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion .
-1 a non-mystery mystery .
-1 going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film .
+1 notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour , i'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
+1 smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes .
+1 it turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting .
-1 succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies .
-1 goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .
+1 here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix .
+1 there's no reason to miss interview with the assassin
-1 one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way .
-1 due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality .
-1 it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part .
-1 nicks , seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .
-1 leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
+1 one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature .
-1 the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it .
-1 choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
+1 escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie .
-1 one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations .
+1 the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience . it has fun being grown up .
+1 it may not be particularly innovative , but the film's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding .
+1 the saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and the quiet american brings us right into the center of that world .
+1 invincible is a wonderful movie .
+1 majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places .
+1 everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting .
-1 the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
+1 exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza .
+1 khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum .
+1 one hour photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it's just too bad it doesn't have more flashes of insight .

-1 at times , it actually hurts to watch .
-1 a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder

-1 [green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike .
+1 there are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness .
-1 the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .
+1 what's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children .
-1 . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits .
-1 the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long .
-1 once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .
-1 warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard .
-1 in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .
-1 too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks .
-1 the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication .

-1 death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again .
+1 sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this argentinean 'dramedy' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors .
-1 [less a movie than] an appalling , odoriferous thing . . . so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you'll want to crawl up your own * * * in embarrassment .
-1 egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose .
-1 it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
-1 unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg .
+1 . . . a magnificent drama well worth tracking down .
+1 williams creates a stunning , taxi driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity .
-1 what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .
+1 among the year's most intriguing explorations of alientation .
-1 the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america .

+1 one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .
-1 it's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil' bow wow .
-1 a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel .
-1 the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
-1 your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make .
+1 the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and . . . often misconstrued as weakness .
-1 mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
-1 even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie .
+1 coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching .
+1 this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder .
+1 made me unintentionally famous — as the queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby . but believe it or not , it's one of the most beautiful , evocative works i've seen .
-1 staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .
+1 there was time on that second round to see the subtleties of ramsay's portrait of grief .

+1 claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that's okay .
-1 too close to phantom menace for comfort .
+1 a coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clichés and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood .
+1 it is great summer fun to watch arnold and his buddy gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters .
+1 brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression .
+1 . . . " bowling for columbine " remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film . . .
-1 without shakespeare's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish .
+1 zany , exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure .
-1 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .
-1 is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?
+1 visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it's the very definition of epic adventure .
+1 the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites .
-1 i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .
+1 a sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise .
+1 there are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why .
+1 i am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here .
+1 the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity .

-1 jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films .
+1 a highly watchable , giggly little story with a sweet edge to it .
-1 barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality .
+1 a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats .
-1 it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long .
-1 never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . "
+1 makes the case for a strong education and good teachers being more valuable in the way they help increase an average student's self-esteem , and not strictly in the knowledge imparted .
-1 cinematic poo .
-1 a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .
-1 plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .
+1 i stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights .
+1 you don't know whether to admire the film's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace . or both .
-1 crikey indeed .
+1 a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more .

-1 like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
+1 as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust .
+1 beating the austin powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness .
-1 it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .
+1 although german cooking does not come readily to mind when considering the world's best cuisine , mostly martha could make deutchland a popular destination for hungry tourists .
-1 jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability .
+1 meant to reduce blake's philosophy into a tragic coming-of-age saga punctuated by bursts of animator todd mcfarlane's superhero dystopia .
-1 except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .
+1 though it's not very well shot or composed or edited , the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal , the film shatters you in waves .
+1 smith's point is simple and obvious -- people's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers .
+1 often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie .

+1 robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favour of an altogether darker side .
+1 an intoxicating experience .
+1 …an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller .

+1 vera has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores .
-1 like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .
-1 might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people .

+1 satisfyingly scarifying , fresh and old-fashioned at the same time .
+1 a moody horror/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director's well-known narrative gamesmanship .
+1 as a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it doesn't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions .
+1 illuminating if overly talky documentary .
+1 a rarity among recent iranian films : it's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight .

-1 a grating , emaciated flick .
+1 a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love .

-1 has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .
-1 it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .

+1 mr . deeds is , as comedy goes , very silly -- and in the best way .

+1 full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing .
+1 it thankfully goes easy on the reel/real world dichotomy that [jaglom] pursued with such enervating determination in venice/venice .
+1 grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue .
-1 the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .
+1 the writing is clever and the cast is appealing .
+1 sure , it's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it's never as solid as you want it to be .
+1 a superlative b movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing .

+1 it's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by kwan's unique directing style .
-1 memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .
-1 the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned .
+1 cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film's saving graces .
+1 a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last .
+1 in a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting .
+1 in many ways , reminiscent of 1992's unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue .
-1 one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .
-1 it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will .
-1 it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf .
+1 bring on the sequel .
-1 i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
-1 little more than a frothy vanity project .
-1 . . . plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried .
-1 rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
-1 feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place .
+1 it's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming .
-1 suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood .
+1 attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage .

+1 the story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one .
+1 'moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism . '
+1 a painfully funny ode to bad behavior .
-1 this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmm…might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ?
+1 ( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning . . . ( but ) lohman's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer . . .
+1 i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound .
+1 a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making .
+1 strange and beautiful film .
+1 it's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements .
-1 a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie .
-1 a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .
-1 absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying .
-1 the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold .
+1 bennett's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any 'reality' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first .
-1 it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals .
-1 although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun .
+1 more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem .
-1 oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
-1 shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
+1 . . . while dark water isn't a complete wash ( no pun intended ) , watched side-by-side with ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor .
+1 for his first attempt at film noir , spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future .
-1 if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter .
-1 better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .
+1 you'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness , but the point is , you'll laugh .
-1 a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .
+1 pretty good little movie .
-1 the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .
+1 a poignant lyricism runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem .
+1 at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second .
-1 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut .

+1 the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise .
+1 mr . spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned . and they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor .
+1 not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions .
-1 a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .
-1 a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man's quest to find an old flame .
-1 new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is .
-1 one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch .
+1 the film is darkly atmospheric , with herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath hearst's forced avuncular chortles .
-1 the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .
+1 muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they don't have , and how this gets us in trouble . but even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic .
+1 the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing .
+1 the film's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that's opened between them .
-1 entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
-1 a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
-1 with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion .
+1 fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out .
+1 evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes .
+1 . . . a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet .
+1 kinnear . . . gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life's ultimate losers .
-1 a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .
+1 like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls .
-1 essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
-1 sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
-1 gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .
-1 an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions .
-1 flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent .
-1 like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party .
+1 a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script .
-1 serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
+1 leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama .
-1 forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .
+1 if villainous vampires are your cup of blood , blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest .
-1 an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship .
+1 more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . .
+1 in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in .
+1 an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction .
+1 red dragon makes one appreciate silence of the lambs .
+1 it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days .
-1 authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow .
-1 . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might .
+1 features fincher's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity .
-1 a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . .
+1 that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed .
-1 the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .
+1 it's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor .
-1 kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention .
-1 mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid .
+1 by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre .
+1 a sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire .
-1 it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
-1 all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .
+1 elling builds gradually until you feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy .
-1 earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
-1 largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers .
+1 good ol' urban legend stuff .
+1 a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps .
-1 with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .
-1 there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right .
-1 this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts .
-1 they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .
+1 poetry in motion captured on film . while it can be a bit repetitive , overall it's an entertaining and informative documentary .
-1 just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .
+1 romanek's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals . beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures .
+1 the underworld urban angst is derivative of martin scorsese's taxi driver and goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself .
+1 solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts .
-1 almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that's a liability .
+1 in my opinion , analyze that is not as funny or entertaining as analyze this , but it is a respectable sequel .
-1 . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise .
-1 cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .
-1 the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .
+1 [f]rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels .
+1 the journey to the secret's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough .
-1 friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite .
+1 at times the guys taps into some powerful emotions , but this kind of material is more effective on stage . it's not a motion picture ; it's an utterly static picture .
+1 mr . clooney , mr . kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster .
-1 a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
-1 the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man .
+1 if the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .
-1 shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .
+1 this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family .
-1 doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films .
-1 . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags .
+1 it does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity .
+1 pan nalin's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic .
+1 it's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team .
+1 like a south-of-the-border melrose place .
-1 velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene .
+1 easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-semitism ever seen on screen .
-1 it's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .
+1 it's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you don't try to look too deep into the story
+1 it is an indelible epic american story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives .
-1 what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .
+1 you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .
-1 worthy of the gong .
-1 ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .
-1 disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies…or any other john woo flick for that matter .
-1 the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles .
+1 the pleasure of read my lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string . we're drawn in by the dark luster .
+1 it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame .
-1 the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .
+1 a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe .
-1 it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed .
-1 conforms itself with creating a game of 'who's who' . . . where the characters' moves are often more predictable than their consequences .
-1 tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool .
+1 perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
+1 the sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack .
-1 watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen .
+1 the film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed .
-1 whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary .
+1 stuart's poor-me persona needs a whole bunch of snowball's cynicism to cut through the sugar coating . but once the falcon arrives in the skies above manhattan , the adventure is on red alert .
+1 impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises .
-1 a bit too eager to please .
+1 at the end , when the now computerized yoda finally reveals his martial artistry , the film ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside .

-1 statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british .
-1 there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
-1 i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back .

-1 scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .

+1 it inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental 'picture shows . '
-1 the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
-1 'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo místico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensación de inconformidad que hace pensar más de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '

-1 unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .
-1 mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .
+1 though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting .
-1 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already .

+1 the paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final ( restored ) third…emotionally belittle a cinema classic . sometimes shorter is better .
-1 it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you'll feel like mopping up , too .

-1 sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out .
+1 we root for [clara and paul] , even like them , though perhaps it's an emotion closer to pity .
-1 the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy .
-1 it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
-1 a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick .
+1 preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment .
+1 . . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor .
+1 as averse as i usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream hollywood fantasies , this one got to me .
+1 that jack nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend .
-1 while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor .
-1 the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier .
+1 one of the most original american productions this year , you'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state .
+1 films are made of little moments . changing lanes tries for more . it doesn't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received .
+1 a portrait of an artist .
+1 about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream .
+1 the movie's captivating details are all in the performances , from foreman's barking-mad taylor to thewlis's smoothly sinister freddie and bettany/mcdowell's hard-eyed gangster .
+1 it's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just can't take it any more .
+1 ou've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane .
-1 the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
-1 the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
-1 helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge .
-1 with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .
+1 cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as i'm the one that i want . . . but it's still damn funny stuff .
-1 bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places .
-1 a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '
+1 in all , this is a watchable movie that's not quite the memorable experience it might have been .
+1 an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone .
+1 skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise .
+1 yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack . . . and his chemistry with shimizu is very believable .
-1 some episodes work , some don't .
-1 neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .
-1 charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing .
-1 if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta .
+1 witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful .
+1 literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds .

+1 the script is smart , not cloying .
+1 wow , so who knew charles dickens could be so light-hearted ?
-1 haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .
+1 while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel .
-1 " bad " is the operative word for " bad company , " and i don't mean that in a good way .
-1 the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .
+1 exhilarating but blatantly biased .
+1 the series' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives remains prominent , as do the girls' amusing personalities .
-1 sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
-1 nearly every attempt at humor here is doa .
+1 moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out .
-1 despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .
-1 a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .
+1 meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment .
+1 like other great documentaries . . . this goes after one truth ( the ford administration's complicity in tearing 'orphans' from their mothers ) and stumbles upon others even more compelling .
-1 chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .
-1 it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
+1 may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow .
-1 although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
-1 it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .
+1 a charming , banter-filled comedy . . . one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface .
+1 sexy and romantic .

-1 given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is .
-1 the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .
-1 the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
-1 it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .
+1 the difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited .
+1 this is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies .
-1 simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn .
-1 it's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy .
-1 gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up .
-1 everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line .
+1 thought-provoking and stylish , if also somewhat hermetic .
+1 the film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant .
+1 though it's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans' saga of hollywood excess .
+1 some of the most ravaging , gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since " saving private ryan " have been recreated by john woo in this little-known story of native americans and their role in the second great war .

+1 a classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached .

+1 provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views .
+1 two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama .
+1 over the years , hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor .
+1 an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind .
-1 none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens .
-1 blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .
-1 this is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
+1 angel presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale .
-1 sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .
+1 she may not be real , but the laughs are .
+1 what distinguishes time of favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts .

+1 buy is an accomplished actress , and this is a big , juicy role .

-1 godawful boring slug of a movie .
-1 van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers .
+1 both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes .
+1 the year's greatest adventure , and jackson's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate .
+1 devotees of star trek ii : the wrath of khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu , and the grandeur of the best next generation episodes is lacking .
+1 diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful .
+1 ice age won't drop your jaw , but it will warm your heart , and i'm giving it a strong thumbs up .
-1 all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
-1 although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ‘70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .
+1 the leanest and meanest of solondz's misanthropic comedies .
-1 after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .
+1 starts slowly , but adrien brody – in the title role – helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying .
-1 it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .
-1 the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york .

+1 a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers . . .
-1 one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
-1 the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
+1 the film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence .
-1 analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .
+1 there is something that is so meditative and lyrical about babak payami's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot . . . a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics
+1 with 'bowling for columbine , ' michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear .
-1 it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .
+1 . . . flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags .
-1 it doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
+1 for decades we've marveled at disney's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . prepare to marvel again .
-1 naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep .

-1 sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower .
-1 resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail .
+1 occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going .
+1 where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment .

+1 land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored .
+1 spiderman rocks
+1 the modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals . it's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after .
+1 steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate manhattan denizens--especially the a * * holes .
-1 a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .
-1 it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins .
+1 if the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that's because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in…and making you sweat .
-1 often silly – and gross – but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .
+1 on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion .

-1 an encouraging effort from mccrudden
+1 an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best .
-1 mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .
+1 it's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive .
-1 the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition .
+1 will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues .
-1 it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
+1 a mischievous visual style and oodles of charm make 'cherish' a very good ( but not great ) movie .

-1 the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
+1 quietly engaging .

-1 a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect .
-1 has the feel of an unedited personal journal .
-1 beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .
-1 like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .
-1 this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .
-1 attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
-1 it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire .
+1 [clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh .
-1 the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
-1 . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .

-1 disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .
+1 using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead .
-1 . . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .
-1 how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know .
-1 plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread .
-1 essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty .
+1 it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya .
-1 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
-1 what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor .
-1 the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything .
+1 it's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear .
+1 this is pure , exciting moviemaking . you won't exactly know what's happening but you'll be blissfully exhausted .
+1 mastering its formidable arithmetic of cameras and souls , group articulates a flood of emotion .
+1 . . . a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year .
+1 if you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite .
+1 ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis .
+1 underachieves only in not taking the shakespeare parallels quite far enough .
-1 overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
+1 the music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and italy beckons us all .
-1 several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante .
+1 claire is a terrific role for someone like judd , who really ought to be playing villains .
-1 a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at .
+1 with so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine .
-1 the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .
+1 daring and beautifully made .
-1 stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .
-1 coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit .
+1 passable entertainment , but it's the kind of motion picture that won't make much of a splash when it's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards .
-1 an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
+1 when it's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama , " real women have curves " is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams .
-1 not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny .
+1 irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy .
-1 it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .
+1 what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material .

-1 starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion .
+1 uplifting , funny and wise .

+1 it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart
-1 if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil .
-1 trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein's brain .
-1 in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
+1 an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent .
+1 entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together .
+1 . . . once the true impact of the day unfolds , the power of this movie is undeniable .
-1 morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either .
-1 drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .
+1 although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film doesn't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything .
+1 williams absolutely nails sy's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness .
+1 this harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked .
+1 [reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch .
-1 it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun .
-1 a cockeyed shot all the way .
+1 in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st .

+1 its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart .
+1 a must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle .
+1 the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses .
-1 began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course .
-1 depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply .
+1 with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill .
+1 an almost unbearably morbid love story .
-1 there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
+1 campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful .
-1 spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together .
-1 what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .
-1 stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .
-1 while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .
+1 though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium .
+1 because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions .
+1 it's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old ferris bueller .
+1 may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation .
-1 a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level .
-1 you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this .
+1 it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes .
-1 beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .
+1 if you're a fan of the series you'll love it and probably want to see it twice . i will be .
-1 what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song .
+1 not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly .
-1 it's just plain boring .
+1 it may sound like a mere disease-of- the-week tv movie , but a song for martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses seldahl and wollter .
-1 i know we're not supposed to take it seriously , but i can't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary .
-1 gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés .
+1 chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution .
-1 is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ?
-1 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
+1 it's funny , as the old saying goes , because it's true .
-1 tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
